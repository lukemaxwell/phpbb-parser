      "content": "i have a strange issue with getting the status.xml file from the vlc http server. I am using this curl command Code: Select allcurl -s -u :password http://127.0.0.1:8080/requests/status.xml -o /tmp/status.xml it works fine from command line (bash shell). but if i put the curl command in a script and run the script it won't work. debug info shows that it can't connect to 127.0.0.1. strange thing is i figured out it will work from a script if the /tmp/status.xml file already exists. i've tried several variations/options of the curl command and tried using wget too, still same behavior. i'm not sure if this is an OS, bash, curl or vlc issue. using vlc 3.0.11.1-2 and archlinux 5.8.3",
